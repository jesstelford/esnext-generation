# Solution

For comparison, here is a possible solution, so you can compare notes:

```js
module.exports = function *multiplier() {
  var num = 0,
      mul = 1;

  while(true) {
    num++;
    mul = yield num * mul;
    mul = mul || 1;
  }
}
```

# Next Steps

## learn-generators Workshop

For more advanced usage (and to re-iterate some topics from this set of lessons), see the `learn-generators` workshop:

```bash
$ npm install -g learn-generators
$ learn-generators
```

Now that you know the history of how Iterators and Generators came to be, and
how to use them in the real-world, `learn-generators` will take you deeper into
some interesting use cases such as: making async code look sync, catching errors
in generators, and using ES6 Promises with generators.
